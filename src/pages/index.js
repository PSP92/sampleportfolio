      <p>
      I'm a versatile full-stack developer with a background of ten plus years in customer service. 
      I am a leader and problem solver who is always up for a challenge. 
      From the shores of Guam to the big city of Seattle I am constantly learning what it means to be adaptive to new things, and I bring this mindset to my work as an engineer.
