If you had asked me 4 months ago if I would be a Full stack engineer, I wouldn't have believed you. I have been working for the past 11 years in various forms of customer service. I would say I was comfortable with the work I was doing, but I felt like I was missing something. Not only that, but I was missing my purpose. I felt like I could contribute more to something bigger. I was in the health field and I wanted to challenge myself. So one day, while I was searching for nursing schools around me, I happened to find a link to a coding Boot camp. And this is where my true story begins......



##

I had a simple understanding of what coding was. You would think my Myspace days of picking a theme would have prepared me for what was to come. At the end, that could not even begin to cover what I was going to learn. I finally decided to apply after much research and asking myself multiple times if I could swing it and said at this point I have nothing to lose. I have applied to schools before, but the tests to get into coding were a challenge in and of itself. I had so much fun working on mini projects and taking the test and passing. It was like I could see myself finally doing something important. But most importantly doing something for me. 



##

I must caution these tests and mini-projects didn't prepare for me the intensity of what I was to face. The first I thought to myself I'm never going to make it. My dreams of being the best ethical hacker in the world were slowly crumbling. This was just the beginning. We were learning CSS and HTML! I only laugh now because I'm finished, but at the time I was like I'm the worst person in my class. I had the biggest fear that I wasn't who I thought I was. This is when my worst critic, hint: myself, started to tear into me like I was never going to amount to anything. Then something changed I had forgotten who I was and thanks to the most supportive family I could ever ask for they reminded me of such.

I took that first week as I had ZERO coding experience, besides Myspace 100 years ago, and of course, I was going to be frustrated. I was just frustrated I didn't know everything already, which is ridiculous, and I wasn't like some of my classmates. Like I said, I'm my own worst critic. After taking time to breathe and relax, everything didn't magically start to make sense, but I stopped being so hard on myself. Then one week we started to learn Algorithms, and we had to pair up with classmates. In these sessions, I would just pick their brain "How are you feeling so far?" and I kid you not we all felt if not entirely the same but pretty close to how I was feeling. I sat there and was beating myself up only to find out my classmates were in the same boat. Now we could all be open with each other, and I think that's how some of the best relationships with my classmates started. It was so extremely wonderful to have their support and shoulders to lean on.

So if you were to ask me today would I do it all over again?........ I would do it in a heartbeat. I learned so much in the 13 weeks I was at GA. We moved at such a fast pace that I'm so proud of myself that I made it this far. I learned many languages and I made many friends. I had the best teachers I could ask for, and this is only the beginning. Here I come, Seattle!
