If you had asked me 4 months ago if I would be a Fullstack engineer I wouldn't have believed you. I have been working for the past 11 years in various forms of customer service. I would say I was comfortable with the work I was doing, but I felt like I was missing something. I was miss my purpose. I felt like I could contribute more to something bigger. I was in the health field and I wanted to challenge myself. So one day while I was searching for nursing schools around me I happened to find a link to a coding bootcamp. And this is where my true story begins......


I had a simple understanding of what coding was.
